# Citrea Wallet Integration Requirements

## Introduction
This specification defines the requirements for implementing comprehensive wallet integration features in the Citrea Boilerplate template, including wallet connection display, balance fetching, network information, and template usage facilitation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Wallet Information Display
**User Story:** As a connected wallet user, I want to see my wallet address, network, and balance clearly displayed in the UI, so that I can verify my connection status and account information at a glance.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN a wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL display the truncated wallet address (first 6 + last 4 characters)
2. WHEN a wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL display the current network name (Citrea Testnet)
3. WHEN a wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL display the wallet balance with full 18-decimal precision
4. WHEN no wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL NOT display wallet information components
5. WHEN wallet information is displayed THEN the system SHALL use appropriate visual styling matching the amber theme

### Requirement 2: Real-Time Balance Fetching
**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to see my current balance fetched directly from the blockchain, so that I have accurate and up-to-date financial information.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN wallet is connected THEN the system SHALL fetch balance using viem public client
2. WHEN balance is being fetched THEN the system SHALL display loading indicators
3. WHEN balance fetch fails THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages
4. WHEN balance is fetched successfully THEN the system SHALL display the balance in cBTC with full precision
5. WHEN balance fetch encounters provider errors THEN the system SHALL use direct RPC calls instead of Privy provider

### Requirement 3: Manual Balance Refresh
**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want to manually refresh my balance, so that I can get the latest balance information without reconnecting my wallet.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN wallet balance is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a refresh icon beside the balance
2. WHEN the refresh icon is clicked THEN the system SHALL trigger a new balance fetch
3. WHEN refresh is in progress THEN the system SHALL show spinning animation on the refresh icon
4. WHEN refresh is disabled THEN the system SHALL prevent clicking and show disabled state
5. WHEN refresh completes THEN the system SHALL update the displayed balance immediately

### Requirement 4: Template Creation Facilitation
**User Story:** As a developer, I want easy access to the GitHub CLI command for creating a new project from this template, so that I can quickly start a new Citrea project without searching for documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN viewing the boilerplate homepage THEN the system SHALL display the GitHub CLI command prominently
2. WHEN the CLI command is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide a copy button for easy copying
3. WHEN the copy button is clicked THEN the system SHALL copy the command to clipboard
4. WHEN copying is successful THEN the system SHALL show visual confirmation feedback
5. WHEN the command is displayed THEN the system SHALL include proper installation guidance

### Requirement 5: GitHub Template Configuration
**User Story:** As a template maintainer, I want the repository configured as a GitHub template, so that other developers can easily create new repositories from this boilerplate.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN the repository is configured THEN the system SHALL be marked as a GitHub template
2. WHEN template is created THEN the system SHALL include updated README with proper template instructions
3. WHEN template is used THEN the system SHALL provide clear setup and configuration guidance
4. WHEN template documentation is updated THEN the system SHALL reflect Citrea-specific configuration instead of generic web3 setup
5. WHEN template is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide multiple creation methods (CLI, web interface, manual clone)

### Requirement 6: Error Handling and Resilience
**User Story:** As a wallet user, I want robust error handling for wallet operations, so that I have a smooth experience even when blockchain interactions fail.

#### Acceptance Criteria
1. WHEN wallet connection fails THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages
2. WHEN balance fetching encounters network errors THEN the system SHALL retry with fallback methods
3. WHEN chain switching fails THEN the system SHALL provide retry options
4. WHEN provider errors occur THEN the system SHALL fallback to direct blockchain calls
5. WHEN any wallet operation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors for debugging while showing helpful user messages
