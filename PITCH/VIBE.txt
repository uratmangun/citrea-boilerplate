Kiro excels at full-stack project scaffolding. Start with specs for complex features, use steering rules for team standards, and leverage hooks for automation. Best workflow: define requirements clearly, let Kiro generate complete component structures with TypeScript types, then iterate on specific features. Kiro handles Vite+React+Supabase+shadcn setups in minutes, creates proper error boundaries, implements routing, and maintains consistent code patterns. Use parallel tool calls for efficiency.
