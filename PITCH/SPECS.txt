Kiro specs provide structured feature development through three key files: requirements.md defines user stories with acceptance criteria, design.md outlines technical architecture, and tasks.md breaks work into trackable implementation steps. This spec-driven approach ensures clear requirements capture, systematic design thinking, and incremental progress tracking. The vite-react-supabase-shadcn spec demonstrates how complex full-stack features get decomposed into manageable tasks with clear dependencies and completion criteria.
