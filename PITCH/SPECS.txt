Kiro specs use a structured 3-file approach: requirements.md (user stories with EARS notation), design.md (technical architecture), and tasks.md (trackable implementation steps). Each spec breaks complex features into discrete, testable components with clear acceptance criteria. This spec-driven development ensures consistent documentation, reduces implementation errors, and provides clear progress tracking through checkbox-based task lists.
