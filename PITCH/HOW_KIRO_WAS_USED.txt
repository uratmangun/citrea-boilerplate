Kiro AI accelerated development through 5 comprehensive specs (wallet integration, homepage redesign, navigation, Privy integration, full-stack setup), 19 automation hooks (README generation, git commits, spec creation, license generation), and 6 steering rules (shell preferences, package managers, Supabase configs). Structured development with requirements/design/tasks methodology. Automated documentation, code generation, and workflow management saved 60+ hours of manual work.
